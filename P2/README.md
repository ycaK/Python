# P2 - Program that scrolls your mouse over network

- You need to have pywin32 to use server (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20220/)
- For this program to work over the internet you need to change the "IP" in client.py and server.py from the default to the server ip
- You can get the ip by typing ipconfig on windows or ifconfig on linux
- You can test the program localy without having the server on other computer (default ip: 127.0.0.1)
